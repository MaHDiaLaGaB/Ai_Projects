# AI Projects

This Projects are part of **CS50AI** this course explores the concepts and algorithms 
at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give 
rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine 
translation. 

Projects topics like:
- graph search algorithms.
- classification. 
- optimization. 
- reinforcement learning.

Each project has been implemented the ToDo part by me.
